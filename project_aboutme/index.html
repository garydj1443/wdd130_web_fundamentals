Hi everyone,
<br><br>
<p>I'm majoring in web development. I am from Lake Havasu City, Arizona and I currently live there with my family. My wife and I have 2 boys and a baby girl and they are our pride and joy. We bought a 43' 5th-wheel and we have been living in it for a little over a year now. My wife has been working as a nurse during that time but our goal is to have her work as a traveling nurse and have me work remotely so we can live anywhere we want. That's us in a nutshell. Can't wait to get started in this course.</p>
